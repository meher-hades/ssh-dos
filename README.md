i dont take any ownership of any misuse of said code , as it is for only education purposes and load testing .
sedning multiple requests to ssh service on different servers at same point loading the ps process to max threshold to make the ps unstable.
run the env-check first to see the discrepency and then the final test file for the said purpose.
